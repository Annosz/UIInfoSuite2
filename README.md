If you are here looking for the fix for the new SVE trees not working, what you will have to do is click the dropdown where the button says "<> Code" and click "Download ZIP".
After downloading the ZIP file you will need to have an IDE such as Visual studio. https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/Get_Started#Get_started
Unzip the file and open UIInfoSuite2.sln with Visual Stuido then at the top of the application click the "Build" button and then click "Build Solution".
This should add the mod directly to your mods folder, but if it does not, then in the UIInfoSuite2-master folder you will have to go to DebugBuilds and use the mod from the zip file there.
